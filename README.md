Course Project: Repository Description
====================================

The CourseProject-GettingAndCleaningData Repository is the repository for
the Course Project of the Getting and Cleaning Data.

Author: Ma. Rowena C. Solamo

This is a partial requirement to the Getting and Cleaning Data Course in coursera.org dated May 5 - June 2, 2014 Session under the guidance of Prof. Jeff Leek, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.

The repository contains the following essential files:

1. **run_analysis.R** which contains the R code that performs the following
     * Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
     * Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
     * Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
     * Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names. 
     * Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
     * Write the second tidy data to a file.
2. **CodeBook.md** which contains the code book of the course project.
3. **tidyDataSet.txt** which is the second tidy data set produced by run_analysis.R
4. **CodeBook.html** which is the html version of the CodeBook.md.

The input files are not included in the repository.  They can be obtained from here:
